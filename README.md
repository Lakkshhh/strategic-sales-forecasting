In retail, it is essential to predict sales as accurately as possible since it is the foundation for making well-informed and strategic decisions in a rapidly changing business environment. The project discusses how Rossmann can use machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods to forecast sales. By analyzing historical sales data from 1,115 stores in seven European countries through exploratory data analysis (EDA), which gave insights and features affecting the sales in different stores, this helps in better decision-making by managers and more accurate predictions in the future. It gives doable insights from the data by implementing various models such as Linear regression, Random forest, decision tree XGBoost, artificial neural networks (ANN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Also, working with more precise sales projections at the single-store level with advanced models like Prophet, SARIMAX, and LightGBM with the best parameters. In both holistic and individual approaches, the best models that came out were Random Forest (with R2 = 0.96) and LGBM (with R2 = 0.92). This project aims to make sales forecasts a driver for strategic decisions that would lead to unimaginable operational efficiency by adopting complex methods. The comprehensive approach also hopes to enable retailers to deal with their challenges as well as move around confidently and flexibly in dynamic market settings.
